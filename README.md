About Me! My name is Alex. I am new to coding though I have been casually looking through it for quite sometime now. Currently I work with disabled people.
Its tiring and I dream for a job that is less messy and pays better. Hence, me going to into programming. In my freetime I enjoy videogames, brazilian jiu-jitsu annd rock climbing.
I hope this course goes well for all of us. I fear falling behind and becoming overwhelmed by the work. I feel teaching is a great way to learn, and so if anyone struggles ith a concept that for soe reason I seem to understand I am more then happy to help!
